# Factorial

This is a tool which tells you the factorial for an integer number you give.

## Usage

```bash
$ python factorial.py
```

Type the above command on Terminal or an equivalent terminal shell. Make sure the factorial.py file is in the directory where you are executing the command.

When you do it, you have the following message:

```bash
Enter an integer number >
```

Then you can input a number. If the number you are inputing is negative, you have the following error message and Factorial asks you the above prompt message again until you input 0 or a positive number.

```bash
**Error: Number mustn't be negative.
```

When you give either 0 or a positive number, you'll have the result like this.

```bash
X! = YYY
```

Where X is the number you have given and YYY its factorial.

Note that you can input a number ranging from 0 to 20. If you input more than 20, you have the following error message:

```bash
**Error: Number is too large.
```
